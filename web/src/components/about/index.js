                <strong>HELLO</strong>, my name is Eric Nation, and Iâ€™m a Software Developer originally based out of Phoenix, Arizona.
              For the past 3.5 years I've been working remotely and I have mastered being apart of remote teams. I
              have 8 years of professional web development experience specializing in UI architecture and Javascript technologies.
              </p>
              <p>I have in depth experience with Angular, React, Wordpress, and building component libraries. I also have experience
                and am well versed in full stack Javascript technologies such as Nodejs, Express, and Firebase. I have a passion for
                designing and developing web applications and I'm always hungry to learn more, improve, and advance my skill set.
              </p>
              <p>Other than designing and developing web applications, I enjoy skateboarding, fitness, surfing, riding motorcycles,
                traveling, the outdoors, music, and a bunch of other awesome stuff!
